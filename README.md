![Raytraced render with a lot of fancy objects! metal-based checkerboard floor with a slight fuzziness to it, teal-colored matte teapot on the left, pink matte bunny on the right, golden metal dragon in the back center, a dark metal sphere with slight fuzziness and a hovering clear glass sphere in the front center, and a slightly ominous tall tower of fog in the back left](scene.png)

## Usage

Currently, this project is highly experimental. Things change all the time.

- `clovers/` contains the library
- `clovers-cli/` contains the CLI application

The automatically built documentation is hosted at <https://walther.github.io/clovers/clovers/>.

This project has a [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just). If you have `just` installed, you can run `just` to list the available commands in this project, and run various forms of `just command --option args` to execute them.

If you do not have `just` installed, open the [Justfile](./Justfile) in your favorite text editor to see the various available commands that you can then copy to your shell manually.
